I installed Ubuntu Server 22.04 in an old tablet. When I installed it, it asked me for the wifi connection, which ended up getting stored by default for subsequent use. That's fine, but I want to disable the wifi connection, and instead use the ethernet connection I plugged in via a USB-ethernet converter. Unfortunately, such connection does not get enabled by default, and needs some additional manual tweaking. Here's what I did:

1. Confirm with the `ip` command that the ethernet connection is detected. It does not show up with the name `eth0` as usual, but with a very long and complicated name, `enx1234a1234567`. The wifi connection is `wwlp1s0`:
```
carlos@tabletbox:~$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: enx1234a1234567: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.0.5/24 metric 100 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global enx1234a1234567
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ffff::111:ffff:ffff:1111/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: wlp1s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

2. There are two files created by default under `/etc/netplan` during the server OS installation. One is for the wifi, the other one for the ethernet:

```
carlos@tabletbox:~$ ls /etc/netplan
00-installer-config-wifi.yaml  00-installer-config.yaml
```

3. The wifi file is `00-installer-config-wifi.yaml`. I opened it with `sudo nano` and commented every line:

```
carlos@tabletbox:~$ sudo cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config-wifi.yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
#network:
#  version: 2
#  wifis:
#    wlp1s0:
#      access-points:
#        my-wifi-ssid:
#          password: my-password
#      dhcp4: true
```

4. There is no file describing the ethernet connection since I plugged it in _after_ installing the OS. The configuration should go in the other file, `00-installer-config.yaml`, which originally looked like this:

```
carlos@tabletbox:~$ sudo cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
  version: 2
```

5. I edited that file using `sudo nano` so that it configured the ethernet connection with dhcp on boot:

```
carlos@tabletbox:~$ sudo cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
  ethernets:
    enx1234a1234567:
      dhcp4: true
  version: 2
```

6. Then I ran two commands as sudo: `netplan generate` and `netplan apply`. If it all goes well, these commands should show no output.

7. Then I disabled the wifi connection using `sudo ifconfig wlp1s0 down`.

8. Finally, I confirmed the ethernet connection had a proper IP, and that the wifi connection is not enabled:

```
carlos@tabletbox:~$ ifconfig
enx1234a1234567: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)

        TX packets 14290  bytes 5731069 (5.7 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

1. If you want to make sure the ethernet connection and the wifi will remain that way permanently, reboot the machine, and re-run the `ifconfig` command to verify the output is the same.
